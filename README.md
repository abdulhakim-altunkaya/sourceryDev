Task for Sourcery Developers Admission Test 

Aim: 
This is task prepared for the Sourcery for Developers Admission Test.

Technical Aspects:
This web app is created with HTML and JavaScript.
First part of javascript code (formatNumbers function) is number formatting to let user to enter values with comma.
Second part of javascript code (converthex function) is conversion related coding.
Basic error handlers (if statements) are added to the code to prevent crash.

Content:
The web app is converting RGB values to HEX code values. 

USE:
User should enter 9 digits with values varying between 100-255. I know RGB values can be between 0-99 but as the task requires a single input field with comma separator, values between 0-99 had to be excluded.
